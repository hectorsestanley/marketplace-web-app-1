You must have at least three controllers (Think python functions with @app.route decorators)

You must have at least three views (Think templates)

Your app should have user session management. (anything to do with session management does not
count for the above controller/view requirement or the below database requirements) I recommend you
look at the Flask-Login plugin.

You must use records or SqlAlchemy and create a database with 3-4 tables. These tables should
incorporate a one to many relationship in some way, or they may have a many to many relationship
These tables do not include any tables that you create for user management.

You should incorporate the WTForms module into your application for processing form data. -- You can
teach yourself this from the tutorial.

You must make use of at least 1 web API for some aspect of the project that you use in your web pages.
Or you may define your own API for your app to use on one or more of the pages.

Your program must use the bootstrap templates, and you must make an attempt to make it look aesthetically nice.
